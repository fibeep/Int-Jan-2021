# Neural Network Classifier
------------------
# Description:
> For my intensive I decided I would complete a walkthrough project that explains how to build a neural network classifier at a high level.
> With this project, one can visualize the difference in validation accuracy (whether the model predicts properly) with varying
> levels of data and training epochs.
> Finally, I built my own neural network classifier that classifies images into various categories. The images come from the
> PATHMnist database.

***The entire project, along with the documentation can be found in the google collab notebook listed above.***
